# About Me

## Who I Am

I am a second-year computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia, with a passion for systems and network programming as well as building developer tools.

I am also a tinkerer, and I am always looking for new projects to work on.

## Skills

### Languages
- **C** - Built a heap memory allocator and an interrupt-driven Tron game that runs on an FPGA
- **C++** - Used in my DSA course, and for building a multi-threaded HTTP server
- **Java** - Used in a software construction course and multiple projects
- **Python** - Used for a tutorial project (Flappy Bird with NEAT)

### Interests
- Systems and network programming
- Embedded systems
- Security
- Developer tools and CLI/TUI applications
- Open source contribution (aspiring)

## Background

I do not have the most traditional background in computer engineering. Before university, I planned to study electrical engineering, but changed direction after taking PHYS 158 at UBC during first year. I chose CPEN despite having very limited coding experience beforehand.

Second year was challenging. CPEN 211, CPEN 221, and MATH 220 pushed me hard and made me question whether I was cut out for the program.

I am still here, still learning, and still excited to build. I have learned to focus on steady progress instead of comparison.

Despite school still being demanding, I am excited to keep growing as a computer engineer. I look forward to building projects, contributing to open source, and getting an internship where I can learn from experienced engineers.

**Currently**: Building a multi-threaded HTTP server in C++.
