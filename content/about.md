# About Me

## Who I Am

I am a second year computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia, with a passion for systems and network programming as well as building developer tools. Also, I have a guilty pleasure of vibe coding projects that I can't code myself yet. I tell myself it's for learning, but let's be honest, it's just a means of fun and procrastination. 

JOKING! I do believe there is value in learning new technologies through vibe coding, though it is absolutely not a substitute for actually learning the fundamentals. 

I'm also a bit of a tinkerer, and I'm always looking for new projects to work on. Anyways...

## Skills

### Languages
- **C** - Built things like a heap memory allocator and interrupt-driven Tron game that runs on an FPGA
- **C++** - Currently this is what I use in my DSA course and I am building a multi-threaded HTTP server with it.
- **Java** - Took a software construction course in Java and built a few projects with it.
- **Python** - Only used for a tutorial project (Flappy Bird AI with NEAT)

### Interests
- Systems and Network programming
- Embedded systems
- Security
- Developer tools & CLI/TUI applications
- Open source contribution (aspiring)

## Background

I don't have the most traditional background in computer engineering. Before university, I was set on studying Electrical Engineering, but I quickly changed my mind after taking PHYS 158 (UBC) during my first year... Anyways, I decided to go with CPEN, despite never coding except for one course in first year (APSC 160).

Then second year came around...

During my first term of second year, I felt defeated. CPEN 211 kicked my ass and I heavily relied on AI (which was permitted) to get through CPEN 221. MATH 220 didn't help either... I was questioning my life choices and whether I was cut out for this program.

Fast forward to now, I'm still here, and I'm really enjoying the process of learning and building cool things. I just needed to get out of my head and stop comparing myself to others (some people are just cracked, it's incredible) and embrace the journey! 

So, despite school still being a challenge, I'm excited to see what the future holds and I am excited to continue learning and growing as a computer engineer. I look forward to building projects (not just vibe coding I PROMISE), contributing to open source (again NOT AI SLOP), and hopefully get an internship where I can work under wonderful engineers 10x my skills.

So yeah, that's me.

**Currently**: Building a multi-threaded HTTP server in C++. The project is very much a work in progress, but I'm learning a lot about systems programming and network programming.
